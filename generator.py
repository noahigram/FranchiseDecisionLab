First, create a brief name (3-5 words) for this specific part of the {topic} journey that describes its focus.

2. Builds upon the overall topic but can stand independently
3. Represents a realistic business situation
4. Requires strategic decision-making
5. Has meaningful impact on business metrics (cash, customer satisfaction, growth potential, and risk level)
